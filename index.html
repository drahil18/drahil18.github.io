						<h2>Things that happened</h2>
					</div>
					<ul class="resume-list">
						<li>
							<h4>Crushes and finally meeting</h4>
							<p>Then ek sleepover pe i think kuch i hate you types chal rha tha and you said ki i was your crush. tab 2 sec ke liye meri body me se saari jaan chali gayi thi. but still it was like yar yeh and shriya saathme hai toh maybe this is a prank and i don't want her to stop talking to me if i say ki han i have a massive crush on you. isliye maine woh bola ki i like you as a friend or something. Then shriya ka text aaya and tab bhi i knew ki tu saathme hi hogi uske toh mai shriya ko bhi nahi bol sakta i really love you. Phir uske baad on 17th August hum 3rd person me baat kar rahe the and basically we decided to meet B tower me. Next day on the 18th, aap toh court pe hi baithe rahe and mai stairs me wait karta raha tera. Finally tu aayi wahan and like hum bas ek dusre se puch rahe the tera crush kaun tera crush kaun and like aadhe ghante baat it got really frustating and tu bol rahi thi bas jarahi mai, but still tu wahin ruki rahi and then i think tune bola han ananda me rehta hai woh toh thodi hope badhi meri, but yar like i was really shy like ek bandi rahi meri usko bhi irl nahi bola tha first time, toh it was very ajeeb for me to say it to you. And then like the rest is thoda blurry for me, but i remember i said yes mujhe tu pasand hai and you also said han mujhe bhi tu pasand hai. uske baad things were thoda like okay what do we both do now. Then i guess we just went back home kyuki late hogya tha, and then raatko like mazak me text karte the like ek dusre ko kya nickname de and tab you used to add 'b' to things like yesb okayb and mtlb tab toh for me adding b also was so risky like ooo sahil calling drishti b wow. but abh toh kuch bhi bolte so yes i have gotten kuch zyada hi comfortable with you, i feel i can do anything, act weird, say stupid shit when i am with you and not only will you not judge me, you will join me and be silly with me. </p>
						<li>
							<h4>Coming to Grandspa and cake</h4>
							<p>One night hum log like aisehi baat kar rahe the and mazak me hi bol raha tha mai ghar aajaunga tere and then i thought ki yar i can't say i like you a lot abhi, but if i came outside her balcony like romeo juliet types toh maybe she will understand that. Then mom so rahe the and we were texting and mai tere ghar aa raha tha, maine pucha bhi if guard rokega toh kya bolunga and you didn't think i was serious toh you were like chill hai nahi rokega and all. Thankfully nahi roka guard ne and mai teri society me aagya and phir somehow i found your balcony and i think like you still thought mai mazak kar raha, but finally you came outside and it was really magnetic to see you standing there. You got really excited and shocked ki banda aagya yahan tak and i felt ki yes finally kuch toh hint i was able to give you. mtlb yar bas woh din is really close to my heart. Then next day tu cake banake laayi mere liye and like maine bola gharpe aaja dene ke liye but ofc that was a weird thing to say, but yar mere mind me toh we were already dating toh maine socha nahi itna. Then tu stairs pe aayi to give me the cake, and tune aate hi thappad mara mujhe and bas like woh zor ka toh nahi laga but i was really shocked and like kinda turned on by that. And ofc woh cake hadd se zyada aacha tha and bas yes i felt really special ki drishti ne mere liye cake banaya. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Texting and staying awake</h4>
							<p>Bas then you texted me one day after we met club me and maine reply kiya phir idk kahan khoo gaye aap reply kiya hi nahi. Then raatko i think we talked uss din for the first time, and mtlb uss time ke chats padhta hu toh i can clearly see how much you were trying to tell me ki you love me but i was such a dumbass. Then you suggested me to watch Reign and like first episode se hi i only saw you in queen mary and through her, i saw how good my life would be if i was with you. Phir you and shriya used to have sleepovers and like Shriya and Rudy ki wajah se like we used to talk about relos thoda and then i used to get voice messages from you and sachi bol rha they used to make me really fucking happy. Phir ek din 3 baje tak we were awake and like subconsciously although we didn't say ki we lke each other, we were forming a special bond with each other.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>A rainy day and insta</h4>
							<p>Phir woh din tha, when zyada log the nahi, and baarish start ho gayi thodi thodi. Uss time it was sachi really amazing to watch you in the rain. And then baarish zyada hogyi and i was sitting on the bench with cookie uske umbrella me and you were still there, uss thing ke niche khadi thi. And as the rain poured down harder, you were becoming more and more irresistible to me. Phir i think i took your phone taaki it doesn't get wet, and that moment was like so fucking special for me. Then we went to A tower and like tu sofa pe baithi thi wahan and mera itna man tha wahan baithne ka but mom called and ghar jana pada and i came back you weren't there then club me gaya i found you there i think. all in all woh hadd se zyada awesome din tha mere liye to see you in the rain, your eyes sparkling like fresh drops of dew on a lotus. Uske baad i think insta wala hua, you sent me a request and i ddidn't respond and phir shaamko you confronted me and mai dumb act karne lag gaya like oh tune request bheji thi kya okayokay lemme check. I teased you a bit just to see how you would react if mai accept nahi karta, and you got really angry at me and that was like so hot ki mtlb wow drishti beta public me itna hot nahi markhayegi.</p> 
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Angel on the bench</h4>
							<p>Then uske baad toh, we started to have thoda thoda like mazak, and i think i said ki mai jaldi aajata court pe so hum log khel sakte not you guys, phir you were like theek hai kal mai bhi aaungi. Next day i was really excited, 5 baje aake baith gaya, but you didn't come, toh i thought like oh okay dekhle sahil tu faltu me itna soch raha woh toh bas mazak kar rahi thi. Then like tu aayi toh i asked you aayi nahi and you were like kal pakka. Then next day again mai aaya tu nahi thi toh mai club chala gaya and jab mai wapas aaya, i saw an angel sitting on the bench bathed in sunlight. I felt just so special ki wow yeh bandi mere liye aayi itni jaldi wowowow. we talked thoda uss time and that day was truly magical. thankyou so much for always trying your best to meet me and give me hints </p> 
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Goalkeeping</h4>
							<p>Maybe we talked thoda bohot before, but that day was definitely the most memorable and like biggest day for me. The situation was perfect kyuki sab log bahar the and bas it was us and sab bacche. I was honestly really shocked ki you started talking to me and you were interested to talk to me. For me it was never like mujhe drishti se baat nahi karni, it was more like ik drishti ko mujhme interest nahi hai so what's the point. but that day i saw that you really wanted to talk to me, toh i tried my best to entertain you, ghatiya jokes maru, kuch bhi karu, bas make that day memorable taaki tu ghar jaake soche oh wow woh sahil tha he's a good guy. And bas after that ice breaker, hum thoda thoda baat karne lage. like bench pe ya court pe we used to talk. That was sachi a really exciting time mtlb mai ghar jaake sochta tha wow aaj maine drishti se baat ki wow aaj maine uski bottle se paani piya, it was all so exciting. But still kahin na kahin i was also thinking ki sahil maybe she's just a sweet girl tu faltu me itna mat soch.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Covid wave</h4>
							<p> Bas uske baad thoda blurry hai mere liye kyuki i was thinking ki yar chhod nahi hoga kuch possible yeh bohot zyada khoobsurat hai toh i was just focusing on playing. Uske baad we didn't like talk and all and yeah i was just living the same day everday. bas basketball khelne aao and chale jao. phir 2nd wave aayi, and things were very lonely. i know you really liked me tab but we couldn't do anything. Then lockdown hata and still for me it was like han mai basketball khelne jata hu, and wahanpe ek bohot zyada khoobsurat bandi aati hai, and idk i feel this weird energy ki like im just attracted to her. not like to her body, but like just attracted to her, just wanting to stare into her eyes, just watch her play or sit on the bench, bas look at her.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Seeing you the first time</h4>
							
							<p>I still remember the first time I saw you. I was on the court and you came hamari society me and bas like my jaw dropped and all I could see were your beautiful brown eyes. I was really interested in you from that very moment, but i thought it was another one of those one sided loves that people have. You were like so much upar merese ki i never really even thought of you liking me. And i know ofcourse i am not like first time dekhke pyar hojayega type banda, so it took some time for you to like me. But on the first day itself, i had told myself ki sahil bas chhod nahi koi chance nahi tera iske saath. and tu sochega iske baare me toh faltu me depress hoga.</p>

						<li>
							<h3>Ongoing</h3>
							<h4> <a href = "http://www.rri.res.in/SWAN/SWANRRI.html">Sky Watch Array Network</a></h4>
							<h5>Guide: <a href = "http://www.rri.res.in/aa_avinashdeshpande.html">Avinash Deshpande</a>, <a href = "https://www.iucaa.in/">Visiting Professor, The Inter-University Centre For Astronomy And Astrophysics, Pune</a></h5>
							<p>The Indian SWAN, a potential SKA-precursor, aims not only to significantly enhance Indian observing capabilities in radio but importantly, also to sustainably build & nurture future generations of talented radio astronomers in India to take up the challenges and lead in exciting research in astronomy, including those with the SKA.</p>
						</li>

							<h3>Winter 2019</h3>
							<h4>Adversarial Networks for Single Image Deraining</h4>
							<h5>Guide: <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/pratiknarang/Profile">Pratik Narang</a>, <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani">BITS Pilani</a></h5>
							<p>Rainy weather greatly affects the visibility of salient objects and scenes in the captured images and videos. The object/scene visibility varies with the type of raindrops, i.e., adherent rain droplets on the camera lens, streaks, rain, and mist, etc. Moreover, they pose multifaceted challenges to detect and remove the raindrops to reconstruct the rain-free image. Recently, both CNN and GAN based models have been designed to remove rain droplets from a single image. In this project, we design a simple yet effective GAN framework to achieve improved deraining performance over the existing state-of-the-art methods. </p>

						<li>
							<h3>Fall 2019</h3>
							<h4><a href = "http://solar-center.stanford.edu/SID/sidmonitor/">Solar Flares & other Ionospheric Disturbances Detection</a></h4>
</h4>
							<p>The project aimed at applying Machine Learning methods to predict and classify solar flares and ionospheric disturbances. The predictions were based on data provided by SWPC GOES X-Ray Flux. Data collection is automated from loop antenna using SID software and Python.
</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Spring 2019</h3>
							<h4>Spam Classification on Different Languages</h4>
</h4>
							<h5>Guide: <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/pratiknarang/Profile">Pratik Narang</a>, <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani">BITS Pilani</a></h5>
							<p>The project aimed to be a stepping stone towards making a universal classifier for Spam SMS. A Naive-Bayes classifier was implemented with and CountVectorizer on the SMS Spam dataset. A new dataset was created by mixing 2 large English and Hindi datasets courtesy of UCI and IIITD respectively.</p>
